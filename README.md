# breedspeed_modifier

in here you can find all the code related to the mod it is relatively simple it checks when a baby is created and add a tags to the entities 
and then change their cooldown according to what is stated in the config

mod description
this is a very simple mod and I surprised no one has done it yet. I wanted it so I just had to make it myself. It allows you, through the config, to modify the cooldown for villagers, animals and any other ageable to breed again. you can also change the time necessary for babies to grow up. Makes you save your precious time.

 

By default the time are reduces by half for breeding (from 5 to 2.5 minutes) and 8 minutes to grow up instead of 20. 

Also the animal option is disabled by default because it would also affect custom mobs. It should work without problems but you never know.

 

[for modded animals]: Basically if a mob makes babies and has a cooldown before making a new one it should work. will it work? normally yes but you never know what people do with their code, I would recommend testing it out by putting the values to 10 seconds and see if you can spawn babies and if they grow up immediately., and don't forget it will then affect every mob who makes babies.

 

for 1.14/1.15: the config is text only so you have to quit the game and change the values in the text file breedingspeed-common [ in the config folder]
